# Nitrolinks
A fronted framework for emulating single page apps without the burden of implementing API.

## Install
This package is not in the registry so only direct installation would work:

```$ npm install git+https://github.com/alexzabolotny/nitrolinks.git```

## Use (with Webpack)

Somewhere in the JS files that are loaded on your page add:
```javascript
import 'nitrolinks'
```
